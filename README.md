# Dumpus Server Widget Bot

This Discord bot aims to provide a simple way to expose your server's information to the Dumpus website.

Once you add it to a server, it starts exposing your server information at `https://widget.dumpus.app/:serverId`.
Once you remove it, it stops exposing your server information. No data is stored or cached.

You can install it using the `Dockerfile` in this repository.
